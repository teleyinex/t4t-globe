# CERN LHC@Home: Test4Theory 3D globe

This 3D Globe uses the [Google Chrome WebGl Globe Experiment]() to show the
[Test4Theory](http://lhcathome2.cern.ch) volunteers all over the world in the
last 24 hours.

The web page shows a Play/Pause control that allows you to stop/start the
automatic rotation of the 3D world, so you can pause it if you want to rotate
it yourself with the mouse.

By default the 3D globe will rotate slowly, so you can use it to show it in
as a screen saver in a screen.
